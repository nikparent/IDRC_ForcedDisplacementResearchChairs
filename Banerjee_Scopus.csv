Millions had to leave a part of their lives in search of an alternative, being turned into refugees almost overnight. In West Bengal alone 30 million refugees entered until 1960. In the 1970s the number of people entering from the east was closer to a few million. It is no surprise that partition history has remained a favourite arena of research among scholars and students in India and Bengal, although comparatively the partition of Bengal has been a lesser researched area. The scope of this paper however is beyond that. This chapter will rather attempt to study the political economy of the society in West Bengal during the 50s that was largely shaped by the refugees who crossed over from the then East Pakistan to West Bengal. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Ranabir Samaddar.

Women smuggled into another country often fall prey to traffickers, and efforts to punish those who perpetrate the evil end up victimising the victims.

In the post-colonial period concern remains over undocumented migrants and whether their arrival threatens the nation form.

The book is an outcome of a research program on Globalization, Democracy, Citizenship, Gender, and Peace Studies. The chapters in the book examine the stories of women whose lives are intertwined with borders, who are its markers and who resist everyday violence in all its myriad forms. The borders become zones, where the power and control of one state ends and the other begins. The result is the startling revelation that women not only live on the borders, but in many ways, they form them and are a crucial part of them. The borders become symbolic of spaces where socio-economic and political contests of inclusion and exclusion are played out every day. The essays describe the way in which women negotiate their differences within a state, which in the guise of being democratic, denies space to differences based on ethnicity, religion, class, or gender. The contributors indicate that borders become hostile zones of widespread aggression, where masculinity is privileged. They analyze how most of the traditional efforts made to make geopolitical regions more secure, are nothing but attempts to privilege a masculine definition of security that only results in feminine insecurities. © Mahanirban Calcutta Research Group, 2011.

An overwhelming majority of these women come from the developing world. South Asia is the fourth largest refugee producing region in the world, a majority of whom are women. ‘Refugee women and children form 76 per cent of the total refugee population in Pakistan, 79 per cent in India, 73 per cent in Bangladesh and 87 per cent in Nepal’. The sheer number of women among the refugee population portrays that it is a gender issue. On the basis of examples taken from different refugee experiences in South Asia, this chapter argues that both displacement and asylum are gendered experiences. At least in the context of South Asia it results from and is related to the marginalization of women by the South Asian states. These states at best patronize women and at worse infantilize, disenfranchise and de-politicize them. It is in the person of a refugee that women's marginality reaches its climactic height. By refusing to create a South Asian refugee regime, states in South Asia continue their castigation of non-conforming women to the status of political non-subjects. STATE FORMATION AND THE QUESTION OF ABDUCTED WOMEN The Partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 witnessed probably the largest refugee movement in modern history.

Yet, partition is often interpreted as being beyond gender politics. A corrective entails a new interpretative study of this fracture with a focus on women, which will move beyond women's experiences to metaphoric uses of gender in state politics in a time of crisis. Our questions then are: Was there a politics of gender in the politics of partition? Has that thrown up an alternative meaning of women's identity? Did this emergent feminine identity result in objectification and exclusion of women? These questions assume greater importance if we consider that women's experiences of migration and destitution during partition and the state's response to it is a pointer to the relationship between the women's position as marginal participants in a highly insecure environment and the politics of gender subordination as perpetrated by the state. […] ABDUCTION AND SOME ISSUES A large number of abducted women have been missing during the trans-border movement. On the basis of individual complaints received it seems that the number was well over 50,000.

It is even more baffling to note that twice as many people are enslaved today than during the days of the African slave trade. How can that be and what exactly is human trafficking? Human trafficking can be described as the forced movement of people for purposes of labour, such as prostitution and other kinds of work, including domestic work. If one looks at the history of the term ‘trafficking’ it can be traced back to ‘white slave trade’. Before the great wars it meant the coercion or transportation of Caucasian women to the colonies to service white male officers. From 1904 there were efforts to stop ‘white slave trade’ leading to the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Person and the Exploitation of Others in 1949. It is the Palermo Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime that made trafficking in persons an international criminal offence in the year 2000. The Protocol was drafted to meet all aspects of trafficking, whether for sexual or labour exploitation. The Protocol's objectives are to prevent trafficking, punish traffickers and protect victims. The Protocol urges states to criminalize trafficking. It also specifies the activities, means and purposes that constitute the offence.

Peace is redefined to include in its fold the attempt by women to be a part of the peace making process, reworking the structural inequalities faced by them and their struggle against all forms of oppression. This volume, the third in the series of the South Asia Peace Studies, deals with the myriad dimensions of peace as practised by South Asian women over a period of time. It chronicles the lives of ""ordinary"" women—their transformative role in peace and an attempt to create a space of their own. Their peace activism is examined in the historical context of their participation in national liberation movements since the early twentieth century. The articles in the collection adopt a new approach to understanding peace—as a desire to end repression that cuts across caste, class, race and gender and an effort on the part of women to transform their position in society.

The women's movement has primarily tried to analyse questions of women's autonomy through exploring women's position in law. Among other indicators, women's position in society is often analysed through marriage, divorce and property acts. This paper analyses the evolution of these acts and critiques whether they have led to women's autonomy or merely subsumed questions of autonomy resulting in further marginalization of women in the polity. The paper begins with the assumption that locations matter and that laws affect different women differently, particularly in the context of India where civil law is constantly pitted against personal and customary law. To understand the situation of women in India, therefore, an understanding of the evolution of laws seems necessary, because laws are considered to be primary markers of autonomy.
