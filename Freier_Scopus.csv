During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, multiple studies related political trust to increased compliance with mobility restrictions. Yet these findings come mostly from high-income countries where political trust and wealth correlate positively. In Latin America, both variables correlate negatively, allowing for better testing of competing explanations. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that in Latin America wealth and, counterintuitively, low political trust predict increased compliance. To understand mechanisms, we decompose political trust and wealth into underlying predictors (social protection, corruption, and education) and reinsert them into the model. While education, as a wealth proxy, predicts decreased mobility across all periods, social protection, which was the strongest predictor of political trust, relates significantly to increased mobility, but only at the beginning of the lockdown prior to distribution of emergency support. This suggests the existence of a public health moral hazard early in the pandemic, whereby citizens who benefited previously from government benefits may have been more risk tolerant in the face of the COVID-19 threat. We interpret these findings within the context of the region's recent “inclusionary turn.” Future studies should explore the distinct relationships between political trust, risk perception, and compliance, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and their implications for policy responses to national emergencies. © 2022",Compliance; COVID-19; Social protection; Trust,,"Bird, M.D.; Universidad Del Pac´ıficoPeru; email: md@up.edu.pe",,Elsevier B.V.,1672681,,JEBOD,,English,J.

As such, one expects migrant mental health to change over time. To examine this relationship, we conducted a meta-analysis, the first to our knowledge, to identify the impact of migration phase and migration type on the prevalence of mental health in migrant populations. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and Embase for studies published between January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2020 (Prospero ID: 192751). We included studies with international migrants reporting prevalence rates for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or anxiety. The authors extracted data from eligible studies and tabulated mental health prevalence rates, relevant migration condition (e.g., migration type or phase), and methods (e.g., sample size). Full text review resulted in n = 269 manuscripts included in the meta-analysis examining PTSD (n = 149), depression (n = 218), and anxiety (n = 104). Overall prevalence was estimated for PTSD (30.54 %, I2 = 98.94 %, Q = 10,443.6), depression (28.57 %, I2 = 99.17 %, Q = 13,844.34), and anxiety (25.30 %, I2 = 99.2 %, Q = 10,416.20). We also estimated the effect of methodological and migration factors on prevalence in PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Our findings reveal increased prevalence of mental health due to forced migration and being in the journey phase of migration, even when accounting for the influence of methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Anxiety; Depression; Meta-analysis; Migration; Phase of migration; PTSD,anxiety disorder; Article; depression; female; forced migrant; human; income group; male; mental health; meta analysis; methodology; migrant worker; migration; observational study; outcome assessment; posttraumatic stress disorder; risk factor; anxiety; anxiety disorder; mental health; prevalence; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Humans; Mental Health; Prevalence; Transients and Migrants,"Carroll, H.A.; Department of Psychiatry, United States; email: hcarrol1@bu.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,1650327,,JADID,36367496,English,J.

Via a comparative quantitative analysis of the immigration and refugee laws, as well as implementing regulations, of 20 Latin American countries, we examine the extent of non-discrimination and special protection provided by the region’s migratory legislation. Our results reveal three main findings. First, more recent immigration and refugee laws tend to be more expansive, which reflects the period of migratory liberalisation in the region. Second, while non-discrimination clauses are more dominant in laws, special protection clauses are primarily present in implementing regulations. This suggests that countries see special protection as a tool to positive discrimination of particularly vulnerable groups. Third, although we identify an overall expansion on protection grounds, countries’ migratory laws mostly reflect traditional categories like: sex/gender; race/ethnicity/colour; nationality; economic/social condition; and religion. Overall, although laudable, the impact of these provisions on reversing structural discrimination from an intersectional approach remains questionable. © The Author(s) 2022.",Latin America; non-discrimination; refugees; special protection; Vulnerable migrants,,"Aron Said, V.; Social Sciences, Peru; email: valeria.aron@pucp.pe",,SAGE Publications Ltd,13582291,,,,English,Int.

A core aspect of the new law is the inclusion of an expanded refugee definition derived from the Cartagena Declaration. Nonetheless, it has also been pointed out that implementation gaps persist between Mexico's laws and policy practice. In this paper, we analyse in how far Mexico has applied the Cartagena definition to allegeable asylum seekers. Based on the analysis of a representative sample of 565 Refugee Status Determination (RSD) resolutions, we identify patterns in the country's RSD procedure from 2011 to 2016. On the one hand, we find a 98 per cent recognition rate, under the Cartagena refugee definition, for Venezuelan asylum seekers; on the other hand, a lack of application of the Cartagena definition to Central Americans. We discuss how our findings relate to broader problems associated with the RSD procedure in Latin America, and provide policy recommendations. © 2021 The Authors.

We argue that both structural and contingent regime dynamics shaped a window of opportunity for the reform to take place. We further show how key actors amongst civil society organisations, the executive and the legislative branches formed multi-sectoral coalitions and strategic alliances to turn this policy window into a critical juncture of lasting policy change. Ultimately, legislative reform was successful because it was framed as a human right, and not as an immigration issue.

Based on 50 in-depth interviews and a small N survey, our study suggests that the legalization effect on Senegalese street hawkers' access to the formal sector is limited.

Based on 12 months of qualitative fieldwork, including 72 in-depth interviews, five focus groups, and a survey (N116) in five Peruvian cities, we explore how Venezuelans experience, and make sense of, discrimination and criminalisation in everyday life. First, we discuss how criminalisation compares to general xenophobic discrimination, and other types of discrimination experiences. Second, we juxtapose the prevalence of xenophobic discrimination and criminalisation experiences across the five cities of our study, and between public spaces and the workspace. We then move to the qualitative discussion of the criminalisation experience in these different spaces. Fourth, we discuss how Venezuelan migrants perceive this criminalising discrimination as linked to their villanisation in the media and political discourses. Finally, we discuss our findings and make suggestion for further research.

Using ethnographic research methods, we engaged with Venezuelans living in conditions of informality in four Colombian cities—Barranquilla, Cucuta, Riohacha, and Soacha—and three Peruvian cities—Lima, Trujillo, and Tumbes. We conducted 130 interviews of both Venezuelan migrants and state and non-governmental actors within the healthcare ecosystems of these cities. We found that forced migrants from Venezuela in both Colombia and Peru face common obstacles along their access trajectories to healthcare, which we summarize as legal, financial, and relating to discrimination and information asymmetry. By limiting effective access to care during the pandemic, these obstacles have also affected migrants’ ability to cover the costs of basic needs, particularly food and housing. Our study also found a prevalent reliance on alternative forms of care, such as telemedicine, easy-to-access pharmacies, and extralegal care networks. We conclude that COVID-19 has exacerbated preexisting conditions of informality and health inequities affecting Venezuelan migrants in Colombia and Peru. © 2020",Colombia; COVID-19; Forced migration; Healthcare; Informality; Peru,,"Zambrano-Barragán, P.; Inter-American Development Bank, 1300 New York Avenue NW, United States; email: pzambrano@iadb.org",,Elsevier B.V.,26666235,,,,English,J.

Elevated risks lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and trauma, which makes the question of how migrants cope during such journeys an increasingly important area of research. Current research on migrant religious coping has focused on its use prior to departure and post-arrival. Few studies, however, have considered the role of religious coping during the process of migration. Based on interview data of three African shipwreck survivors travelling from Cape Verde to Brazil, this article discusses how they used religious coping as a positive coping strategy during a month spent lost on the Atlantic Ocean. The use of religious coping strategies directly after arrival is also explored.

Although research has shown that refugees have recently been recast as an economic benefit for non-Western host states, little scholarly work exists on whether and how such a normative change is adopted across regions. In this article, we identify the diffusion of refugee rent-seeking behaviour, namely the use of host states’ geopolitical position as leverage to extract revenue from other states in exchange for maintaining refugees within their borders. We identify three types of diffusion–learning, cooperation and emulation–occurring at state, regional and international levels across the Global South. Drawing on a range of primary sources, we demonstrate the working of these three types across a range of empirical examples drawn from the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Overall, we identify a rising trend in the commodification of forced migration across refugee rentier states, while highlighting the need for further interregional research on policy diffusion outside the Global North. © 2021 The Author(s).

At the same time, academics and policy-makers have long called for crossregional comparative analyses of policies and laws to allow different regions to learn from each other's best practices. In this article, we compare refugee legislations of Latin American countries with European Union protection standards based on UNHCR's legislative good practices across three areas: (i) Core Principles and Scope of Protection; (ii) Procedural Safeguards and Guarantees for Vulnerable Groups; and (iii) Integration. We find that six of 19 refugee laws in Latin America provide more expansive protection than the Common European Asylum System framework, whereas other Latin American countries fall behind. The gap between Latin American legislations and European Union protection standards is closer regarding procedural safeguards, the protection of vulnerable groups, and integration provisions. Finally, Latin American countries, on average, score significantly below the European Union regarding the core principles of asylum and the scope of protection. In the second part of the article, we engage in a qualitative discussion of these legislative good practices to allow for cross-fertilization, and deliver policy recommendations. © Author(s) [2020].

However, this particular definition has only been applied in very few cases. In light of the mass displacement of Venezuelan migrants, and within a context of toughening migration policies, in general, and directed towards the Venezuelan population, in particular, it is necessary to discuss the possible application of the extended definition to this population. Without denying the importance of the political implications of such application, this article addresses the challenges in conceptualizing its situational elements from a legal perspective, specifically focusing on the massive violation of human rights.

First, we use a difference-in-difference design to show that Ecuador’s policy of universal visa freedom led to a significant increase of immigration from previously restricted nationalities in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. Complementary descriptive statistics and qualitative findings confirm the decisive impact visa freedom had on intercontinental south-south migration and suggest three main motives: taking advantage of Ecuador’s open doors as an exit option from origin countries, settlement in Ecuador based on relatively improved opportunities, and transmigration to third countries.

In South America, on the other hand, a liberal discourse of universally welcoming all immigrants, irrespective of their origin and migratory status, has replaced the formally restrictive, securitized and not seldomly ethnically selective immigration rhetoric. This discursive liberalization has found partial translation into immigration laws and policies, but contrary to the universality of rights claimed in their discourses, governments reject recently increasing irregular south-south migration from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean to varying degrees. This paper applies a mixed methodological approach of discourse and legal analysis and process tracing to explore in how far recent immigration policies in South America constitute a liberal turn, or rather a reverse immigration policy paradox of officially welcoming but covertly rejecting irregular migrants. Based on the comparative analysis of Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador, the study identifies and explains South American ""populist liberalism"" in the sphere of migration. We highlight important implications for migration theory, thereby opening up new avenues of research on immigration policy making outside Western liberal democracies, and particularly in predominantly migrant sending countries. © 2015 by the Center for Migration Studies of New York.

An approach combining a transnational perspective and the concept of diaspora space facilitates the analysis of the different scales, agents, and actions involved in migration-caused religious change. The article analyzes the broadening of lutheranism to incorporate Latino Catholic culture into the Evangelical lutheran Church in America (ELCA) in madison, Wisconsin. Under the leadership of their pastor, latin American immigrants in madison are agents redefining the understanding of the category Lutheran through the incorporation of popular Catholicism. Though strongly contested by the Roman Catholic Church, the ELCA accepts these processes due to its institutional interest in the recruitment of new latino worshippers.",Latin american migration; Lutheranism (ELCA); Midwest; Religious change; Transnationalism,,"Freier, L.
